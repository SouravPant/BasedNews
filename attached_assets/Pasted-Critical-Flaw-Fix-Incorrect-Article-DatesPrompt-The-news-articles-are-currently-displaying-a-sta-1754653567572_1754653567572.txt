Critical Flaw: Fix Incorrect Article DatesPrompt:
"The news articles are currently displaying a static, incorrect date of '1/21/1970'. This is a critical bug. You need to modify the frontend to correctly fetch and display the actual publication date for each article.•Objective: Replace the placeholder date with the real publication date from the news API.•Action: In the component that renders each news article, ensure you are accessing the correct date field from your news data source (e.g., article.publishedAt, article.date, etc.).•Formatting: Format the date to be user-friendly, for example: 'Aug 8, 2025', or relative time like '2 hours ago'. You can use a library like date-fns or moment.js for this."Major Flaw: Implement Clickable Article LinksPrompt:
"Currently, users cannot click on news articles to read the full story. This makes the aggregator non-functional. You need to make each article snippet a clickable link that opens the source article in a new tab.•Objective: Allow users to read the full news articles.•Action: Wrap each article card/component in an anchor tag (<a>). The href attribute of the anchor tag should be the URL of the source article, which you should be getting from your news API (e.g., article.url).•Implementation Details:•Use target="_blank" to open the link in a new tab.•Include rel="noopener noreferrer" for security best practices."Major Flaw: Add Article Thumbnails/ImagesPrompt:
"The news feed is text-only and lacks visual engagement. You need to add thumbnails or images to each news article.•Objective: Improve the visual appeal and engagement of the news feed.•Action: In the article component, add an <img> tag. The src of the image should be the URL of the article's thumbnail, which should be available from your news API (e.g., article.urlToImage).•Styling: Ensure the images are styled to be responsive and fit well within the article card layout. Add a placeholder image for articles that don't have a thumbnail."Moderate Flaw: Implement a 'Load More' or Pagination FeaturePrompt:
"The site only displays 10 articles. You need to implement a way for users to load more news.•Objective: Allow users to browse more than the initial 10 articles.•Action: Add a 'Load More' button at the end of the news list. When this button is clicked, it should fetch the next page of results from your news API and append them to the existing list of articles.•State Management: You will need to manage the page number or offset in your component's state to fetch the correct set of articles with each click."
