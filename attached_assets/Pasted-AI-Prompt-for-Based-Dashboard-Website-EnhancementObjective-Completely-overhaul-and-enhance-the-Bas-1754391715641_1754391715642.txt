AI Prompt for Based Dashboard Website EnhancementObjective: Completely overhaul and enhance the 'Based Dashboard' cryptocurrency news and data website (currently at https://based-news-eight.vercel.app/) to transform it into a dynamic, user-centric, and data-rich platform. The goal is a single, comprehensive enhancement without further iterations.Current State Analysis (Key Deficiencies & Areas for Improvement):1.Outdated/Static Data: The most critical flaw is the lack of real-time data. Cryptocurrency prices and news articles (e.g., dated 1/21/1970) are static and severely outdated, rendering the site's core purpose ineffective. Improvement: Implement robust, real-time data feeds for all cryptocurrency prices, market caps, trading volumes, and news articles. Ensure data accuracy and freshness.2.Lack of Data Visualization: The site currently displays raw numbers without any visual representation of trends or historical performance. Improvement: Integrate interactive charting capabilities (e.g., candlestick charts, line graphs) for each cryptocurrency, allowing users to view historical data over various timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, all-time).3.Limited User Interaction & Personalization: There are no features for user accounts, saving preferences, or customizing the dashboard. Improvement: Introduce user authentication and profiles. Allow users to:•Create and manage a personalized watchlist of cryptocurrencies.•Customize the dashboard layout by reordering, adding, or removing cryptocurrency cards and news widgets.•Select preferred news sources and filter news feeds.4.Insufficient Cryptocurrency Detail: Clicking on a cryptocurrency card does not lead to a dedicated page with more information. Improvement: Develop comprehensive, dedicated detail pages for each cryptocurrency. These pages should include:•Detailed price charts with technical indicators.•Market capitalization, circulating supply, total supply, and 24-hour trading volume.•Project description, whitepaper links, official website, and social media links.•Historical performance data and key milestones.5.Incomplete News Experience: News articles are presented as snippets without an option to read the full content or visit the original source. Improvement: For each news snippet, provide a clear link to the full article on its original source. Optionally, implement a feature to display the full article content within the dashboard (e.g., via an embedded viewer or a clean reader mode) while still attributing the source.6.Poor Navigation & Structure: The site lacks clear navigation beyond a basic search bar. Improvement: Implement an intuitive navigation system (e.g., a persistent sidebar or top navigation bar) with clear sections such as:•'Dashboard' (personalized overview)•'Cryptocurrencies' (list of all supported assets)•'News' (comprehensive news feed with filtering options)•'Portfolio' (if user accounts are implemented)•'About/Contact' (standard informational pages).7.Responsiveness & Mobile Optimization: Ensure the website is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). This includes optimizing touch targets, font sizes, and layout for smaller screens.8.User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Refinements:•Search Functionality: Enhance the existing search bar to provide more intelligent, predictive search results for both cryptocurrencies and news articles.•Readability: Improve overall typography, line spacing, and color contrast for enhanced readability of all content, especially news articles and data tables.•Loading States & Error Handling: Implement clear visual indicators for data loading (e.g., spinners, skeleton screens) and user-friendly error messages for data retrieval failures or API issues.9.Community & Social Features (Optional but Recommended): Consider adding features such as:•Social sharing buttons for news articles.•A comment section or discussion forum for news and market insights.Technical Requirements & Design Principles:•Modern Frontend Framework: Utilize a modern,
